The test apps in this folder are excluded from being displayed in VS Code because they automatically activate their respective language extension (C#, Python, etc.) and that can get annoying for our day-to-day development.

If you want to show them, you can temporarily modify the "files.exclude" pattern in `.vscode/settings.json` at the root of this repo.
